# BFD-based tool for appending data to a binary.

This tool is used to add loadable, allocatable section to an ELF file.

The main difference with `objcopy`'s support for adding new sections
is that in the ELF case the program header is also updated.

The file is added in a section at the highest addresses (both VMA and
LMA), thus effectively _appending_ the data to the image.
