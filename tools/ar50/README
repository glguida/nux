# AR50: A simple embedded archive format.

A minimal, both in effort and features, archiver.

AR50 is the simplest possible tool to archive and extract files.

An AR50 archive is quite simple is structure, it is a sequence of
header and file, much like `tar`. As opposed to `tar`, only file name
and size are stored, and furthermore the file name is encoded with
_DEC RAD-50_, thus limiting the length and the accepted charset of the
file, but gaining the advantage of a small, fixed size element in the
header.
